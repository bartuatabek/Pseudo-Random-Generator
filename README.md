# Pseudo-Random-Generator

This implementation uses a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generator and a signature register. The PRBS generator will be implemented using a linear feedback shift register, known as LFSR. A PRBS enables generating almost all required binary patterns for the circuit under test.
